# TicTacToe

A simple JavaScript TicTacToe game.  The focus was on obtaining practice writing JavaScript, NOT on the user's gameplay experience.  Therefore, the computer makes "unintelligent", completely randomized choices. Most adults will find it very easy to win. Additionally, there are still a few minor bugs that have not yet been resolved.
