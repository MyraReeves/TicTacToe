This was a fast, simple JavaScript project.  Although it is a functional game, the main focus was on obtaining practice writing JavaScript, NOT on the user's gameplay experience.

Additionally, my current school workload has not yet allowed me enough time to fix a minor but noticeable bug where the computer takes an extra turn after losing.
